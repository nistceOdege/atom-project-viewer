# How to use Delcam Powermill with Mach3 controller
 
Delcam Powermill is a powerful CAM software that can generate toolpaths for various CNC machines. Mach3 is a popular machine controller software that can control up to 6 axes of motion. To use Powermill with Mach3, you need a post processor file that can convert the Powermill toolpaths to Mach3 compatible G-code.
 
A post processor file is a text file that contains instructions and commands for the machine controller. It can be customized to suit different machines and controllers. Powermill comes with some default post processor files, but you may need to modify them or create your own to match your specific setup.

In this article, we will show you how to find, edit and use a post processor file for Powermill and Mach3. We will assume that you have already installed Powermill and Mach3 on your computer and that you have a 3-axis CNC machine with a Mach3 controller.
 
## Step 1: Find a post processor file for Powermill and Mach3
 
There are several sources where you can find post processor files for Powermill and Mach3. You can check the following places:
 
- The official Delcam website: [https://www.delcam.com/support/downloads.asp](https://www.delcam.com/support/downloads.asp). Here you can find some generic post processor files for different controllers and machines. You may need to register and login to access them.
- The CNCzone forum: [https://www.cnczone.com/forums/powermill/](https://www.cnczone.com/forums/powermill/). Here you can find some user-generated post processor files for various controllers and machines. You can also ask questions and get help from other users.
- The Autodesk Community forum: [https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/powermill-forum/bd-p/208](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/powermill-forum/bd-p/208). Here you can find some user-generated post processor files for various controllers and machines. You can also ask questions and get help from other users.
- The IndustryArena forum: [https://en.industryarena.com/forum/powermill/](https://en.industryarena.com/forum/powermill/). Here you can find some user-generated post processor files for various controllers and machines. You can also ask questions and get help from other users.

For this example, we will use a post processor file that was posted by georgebarr on the CNCzone forum[^1^]. This file is supposed to work with Powermill 2010 and Mach3 for a 3-axis CNC machine. You can download it from here: [fanuc-custom1C.zip](https://www.cnczone.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=2113&d=1256977518).
 
## Step 2: Edit the post processor file for Powermill and Mach3
 
Once you have downloaded the post processor file, you need to unzip it and place it in the folder where Powermill stores its post processor files. The default location is C:\Program Files\Delcam\PowerMILL2010\posts\. You may need to create a subfolder for your custom post processor files.
 
Next, you need to open the post processor file with a text editor such as Notepad or Notepad++. The file name is fanuc-custom1C.pmopt. This file contains some comments and parameters that define how the post processor works. You may need to edit some of these parameters to suit your machine and controller.
