If you are installing version 1.0.1 or later, you also need to decide whether you want to download and install PixInsight LE with or without a local copy of the official documentation. The local copy of the documentation allows you to access the help files offline, but it requires more disk space. The online documentation is always up-to-date, but it requires an internet connection to access it. You can find more information about the help and documentation system in the [PixInsight LE User's Guide](https://pixinsight.com/doc/legacy/LE/05_help/help.html).
 
Alternatively, you can download PixInsight LE from other sources, such as Google Drive. However, we recommend that you always download PixInsight LE from the official website to ensure that you get the latest and most reliable version.
